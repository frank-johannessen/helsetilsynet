					<h1>Mirroring Administration</h1>
					<p>Mirroring is a function that can be used to mirror content from an EPiServer Web 
						site and&nbsp;allows content to be published to:
					</p>
					<UL>
						<LI>
						a remote EPiServer Web site
						<LI>
						HTML
						<LI>
							XML</LI></UL>
					<P>
						EPiServer can be used to mirror selected parts or all of a Web site. Mirroring 
						can run automatically, or you can start it manually. You can&nbsp;mirror from 
						one EPiServer to another, which can be very useful if you wish to create large 
						sections in, for example, a demo site and then publish all the information at 
						once on a remote site. Another useful function: create HTML based Web sites 
						using your dynamic EPiServer, which can be extremely good for archiving.
					</P>
					<p>Mirroring from one Web site to another is built up through channels on the Web 
						site that transmit information. It is also possible to define several channels. 
						Each channel consists of a number of settings for the pages that are to be 
						mirrored and, of these, the types of page to be included. One of a channel’s 
						most important properties is the kind of a channel it is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Tree</b>
						- This function finds all changes made in the tree. It finds pages that have 
						been moved, erased, updated or created. The function finds all the changes from 
						the root page down in the structure. This function is primarily used to mirror 
						an exact tree structure. In this case, a page deleted on one Web site must also 
						be deleted on the other.
						<li>
							<b>List</b>
						- This function works like Tree, except it does not include changes below the 
						first level.
						<li>
							<b>Search</b> - This function finds changed and new pages. It is useful when 
							you wish to mirror news from one Web site to another.
						</li>
					</ul>
