    <h1>Create new page type</h1>
	<p>Administrators do not normally create new page types; this is primarily 
	the task of developers. Each page type is linked to an aspx page (page 
	template), where all the functions of the page are programmed. If you do not 
	have any knowledge about programming in ASP.NET, you should not create new 
	page types. The fields in the form that are filled in by the editors are 
	created in admin mode.<br>
		To create a new page type, select Create new page type from the menu to the 
	left when in admin mode. Fill in the fields shown on the three tabs: 
	Information, Default values and Available page types. </p>
	<h1>Editing page types</h1>
    To edit a page type, click on the page type’s name on the left side. The 
    page type’s various properties are listed on the right. If you select 
    Settings you can change the basic information about the page type to suit 
    your requirements. The settings for each page type come under three separate 
    tabs, Information, Default values and Available page types.
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="images/admin_pagetypes_default.png" width="490" height="221"></p>
    <h3>Name</h3>
    The page type’s name is entered here.
    <h3>Description</h3>
    The text describing the page type is entered here. The name and 
    description are the information displayed to editors when they decide to 
    create a new page.
    <h3>File name</h3>
    This field is for entering the path and file name for the page which will 
    create the actual web page shown to the visitors. This name should not be 
    changed, as each template is linked to a particular page to ensure that it 
    always has the right layout and comes with the all the relevant information.
    <h3>Available in edit mode</h3>
    When you select the option Available in edit mode you are providing the 
    editors with the possibility to create pages based on this page type. In 
    some modes it may be appropriate to hide some of the page types from the 
    editors. This might apply, for instance, to the discussion forum template. 
    It is quite usual to want to have just one discussion forum on the website, 
    as opposed to several in different places. In this case, you create a single 
    forum and then hide the page type. Editors will therefore not be able to 
    access the template, thereby preventing more than one forum beingcreated.</p>
    <h3>Sort index</h3>
    The sort index determines how the various page types will be sor ted in 
    the list when the editor decides to create a new page. The page type with 
    the lowest sor t index comes first.
    <h2>Default values</h2>
    To help and facilitate the editors’ task, it may be appropriate to use 
    default values. If you are an administrator you can then customise a 
    specific page type so that the editor does not need to change much on the 
    page. This might be the case, for instance, if you want the publishing time 
    to be entered automatically. You can then decide how long after the page was 
    created it will start being published.

    <h2>Available page types</h2>
    Here you can choose what page types are to be available to the editor 
    when he creates a sub-page under the page type you are now editing. Choose 
    all page types or select a few specific ones. This can be appropriate, 
    particularly under Questionnaire or Calendar. Sub-pages to the page type 
    Calendar should be of the page type Calendar event. By only providing the 
    editor with access to this page type, there need never by any mistakes.
