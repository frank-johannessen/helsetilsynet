    <h1>Create, save and publish information</h1>
    <p>The process of creating pages in EpiServer can be explained in five 
    steps. Start by deciding where the page is to be placed, create the page and 
    add text and images. Save it and finally publish the page.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mark the page to which you would like the new page to link.</li>
      <li>Create a new page by selecting New page.</li>
      <li>Select the type of page and enter the information you would like to 
      appear on the page.</li>
      <li>Save the page. You are now able to check the page and make any changes 
      necessary changes.</li>
      <li>If you are satisfied with the page, you can pass it over for 
      publication or publish it yourself. It depends on your access rights. If 
      you have rights to publish the pages yourself, you can do this directly by 
      selecting Publish. If you do not have rights, the page should be sent to 
      the person responsible for the publication for checking before it is made 
      available to visitors. You can send the page to the person responsible for 
      publication for approval even if you do have publishing rights, in case 
      you would like someone else to check the content.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Tip!</b><br>
    If you know that you are already happy with the page when you have 
    created it, you can Save and publish immediately, without checking.</p>

    <h1>Create an ordinary information page</h1>
    <p>The most common use of EPiServers is often to create information pages. 
    Depending on how the website is designed and the templates available, 
    information pages can look a little different. Below is a description of how 
    you create a page with the template Ordinary webpage in a standard 
    installation. Read more about other templates in the
    <a href="Editorsmanual_online.pdf">Edtior's Manual</a>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mark the place in the tree structure where you want the page to be 
      located.</li>
      <li>Select New page in the toolbar.</li>
      <li>Select the template Ordinary webpage to view formula for the template.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of the page in the field Name. This name will also 
      appear in the menu later.</li>
      <li>Select the date and time to start and/or finish publication. These two 
      fields can be left empty.</li>
      <li>Mark the alternative Mark the page as changed if you want the system 
      to register that the page has been changed. This has no function if you 
      create a new page, it only registers if you make any changes to an 
      existing one.</li>
      <li>Write an introductory text which describes the page in the field 
      Introduction. This text will only be shown if the page is listed.</li>
      <li>In the field Editor write the information you want to get across. You 
      can format the text here, load images, create links and work with tables. 
      To a large degree you can create anything you want.</li>
      <li>Enter your name in the field Writer.</li>
      <li>Save and view the page.</li>
		<li>Proof the page and if you are not happy with it, reselect <i>Edit</i>.</li>
		<li>If you are happy with it you can select to <i>Publish</i> the page which 
      means it gets accessible to visitors and will appear in menus.</li>
    </ol>
