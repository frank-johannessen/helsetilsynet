    <h1>Permissions for Functions </h1>
    <p>EPiServer’s Edit mode has several functions that allow you to limit the 
    access for certain people or groups. Most functions are connected to the 
    Link tool where the editors can upload images and documents. The following 
    functions can be access protected.</p>
    <p><b>All functions available in the Editor</b> gives one or more groups or persons 
    access to all buttons and functions in Edit mode. You might want to hide 
    certain buttons in certain templates. This command allows you to allocate 
    all the buttons to certain persons or groups. They then get access to all 
    the buttons while others only get the buttons they are allocated for each 
    template. </p>
	<p><b>Detailed error message for troubleshooting&nbsp; </b>provides one or 
	more groups/individuals with access to detailed error messages. In system 
	settings, it is possible to activate a function that provides visitors with 
	a form to fill in whenever there is a technical error on the website. By 
	changing the access rights here, you can specify who should receive these 
	forms.</p>
	<p><strong>Show and publish pages from 
	Microsoft Office Add-in</strong> makes it possible for one or more 
	users/groups to publish pages from Microsoft Office. This function requires 
	that an add-in program is installed on the computer being used. Read more 
	about this in the Editor's Manual.</p>
	<p><b>Allow advanced upload of files using for example drag-and-drop</b> 
	makes it possible to allow a group or individual to use advanced uploading. 
	This means, for example, that an editor can upload several files at a time 
	by dragging and dropping files from Window’s file manager to EPiServer’s 
	file manager</p>

    </ol>
    
    <h2>Accessing functions in the link tool</h2>
	<p>A new link is tool included in version 4.50 of EPiServer. The link tool 
	is the tool that opens when an editor is to upload an image or a document. 
	What the editor can do and not do in the tool is set in the file manager via 
	access rights. Which link tool to use is a configuration question. Read more 
	in web.config Settings. This means that you can upgrade to 4.50 without 
	having to use the new tool. You were are also able to work with directory 
	access rights in previous versions of EPiServer. Many versions have given 
	the editor access to different tools in the link tool. In the older tool 
	there are buttons used to create directories, change names and remove 
	directories and files. It is possible to remove these functions for groups 
	or individuals if required. It is possible for the following functions to be 
	access protected.</p>
	<p><b>Create folder in link tool </b>Gives one or more groups or persons the 
    right to create directories in the link tool</p>
    <p><b>Delete file in link tool </b>Gives one or more groups or persons the 
    right to remove files from the linktool</p>
    <p><b>Delete folder in link tool </b>Gives one or more groups or persons the 
    right to delete directories from the linktool</p>
    <p><b>Rename file/folder in link tool</b> Gives one or more groups or 
    persons the right to change the name of files and directories in the link 
    tool</p>
    <p><b>Upload file to page specific folder </b>Gives one or more groups or 
    persons the right to upload files to the page directories in the link tool. 
    A directory is then linked to the page where all the files are stored. The 
    directory name is made up of digits. </p>
    <p><b>Upload file to common folder</b> Gives one or more groups or persons 
    the right to upload files to the directory or shared directories in the link 
    tool&nbsp; </p>
