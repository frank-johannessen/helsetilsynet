    <h1>Form Settings</h1>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="images/form_inst.png" align="right" width="237" height="295">The form settings dialogue box is used to create the form. Here, you can 
	build up a table and enter the different form fields as you want. You can 
	also select the properties each field is to have. <br>
	At the top of the window you set how you will deal with the information that 
	is sent. 
	<ol>
		<li>In the <i>Name of form</i> field, you select a name for the form. If you are going 
	to send the form by e–mail, the name will be shown in the Subject row on the 
	e-mail message which is sent.</li>
		<li>In the <i>Result from posting</i> field, select what will happen when the visitor 
	sends in the form. You can select to save it in a database and/or send it by 
	e-mail. You can also specify that the form be sent to a web address where 
	you can have a separate application to deal with the information. </li>
		<li>In the <i>Thank you page shown upon response</i> field, you can point to a page 
	that is to be shown when a visitor submits a response. Create the page on 
	the Ordinary web page page template and then select the page as a thank you 
	page.</li>
		<li>The <i>Form can be posted anonymously</i> field should be selected if you want 
	anyone on your website to be able to send in the form. If it is not checked, 
	it will be necessary to be logged on in order to reply. </li>
		<li>The <i>Same person can post the form several times</i> field should be selected if 
	you want the same person (computer) to be able to send the form several 
	times. If this option is left empty, people will only be able to send in the 
	form once per computer. This works by placing a cookie on the visitor's 
	computer. 
	</li>
		</ol>

    <h2>Build up the form</h2>
	In the lower part of Form settings you create a table with the buttons under 
	the table. Add row is always placed at the bottom of the table. Add column 
	is always placed furthest right in the table. If you select Insert row you 
	can insert a row above the row that is currently selected. Insert column 
	gives a column to the left of the column that is selected. Select a row or 
	column by clicking on an inserted field in the cell. If there are no fields 
	in the table, you should start by dragging in a field. 
	<p>Position the various fields by grabbing the field in question at the 
	right-hand edge and dragging it to the required position in the table. Each 
	cell in the table can only contain one form field. </p>
	<p>When you have dragged a form field into the cell, the settings for the 
	relevant field type will be opened under the table. Depending on the field 
	you have selected, you have various settings to make. All fields have the 
	property CSS class. Here, you can fill in an CSS class which exists in the 
	CSS file which is used for the website. Contact your system administrator 
	for more information. </p>
	<p>When all the properties for each field have been 
	completed, the button <i>Save</i> will be shown at the bottom of the window. You 
	must save each individual field and its settings. If you want to Delete a 
	field, click on the <i>Delete</i> button under the settings for the field.
