    <p>
	<img border="0" src="images/EditDynPropTool.gif" width="21" height="21" align="left">Using the <i>Dynamic properties</i> tool, it is possible to customise functions 
    in the website so that they apply to a particular page and its sub-pages. 
    For example, under a branch in the tree, you can determine from where the 
    menus are to be seen. By creating new dynamic properties, you can tailor the 
    structure and functionality of either the entire or parts of the website.</p>
    <p>The different dynamic properties that are present vary considerably 
    depending on which website you have built up and which functions you want. 
    For example, you can set which standard search words are to apply for a 
    page. This is used to make it easier for search engines to find the page and 
    index it in the most appropriate way. These search words may need to be 
    different depending on which page they relate to. The page about our 
    products should perhaps have different search words from the page containing 
    contact details. By entering a few search words and choosing Save, you can 
    save the particular search words for the page in question. If you click in 
    the check box beside the field, the search words you have specified are also 
    saved for all the sub-pages below the page you have selected.</p>
	<p>
    <img border="0" src="images/dynamiska_egenskaper.png" width="490" height="245"></p>
    <p>To find out which values apply to a particular page, you can point to the 
    various symbols by the input box under dynamic properties and find out about 
    the value by means of help texts.</p>
    <p>* The value in this field is defined on the page you have selected and 
    is displayed in the field.</p>
    <p>? The value in this field has no value.</p>
    <p>^ The value in this field is defined on a page higher in the structure 
	and this page has inherited it. The value is displayed in a help box by pointing to the symbol.</p>
    <p>If you choose to save a new value for a dynamic property, the value is 
    saved for the page you selected before you chose <i>Dynamic properties</i>. If you 
    also want the value to apply to all sub-pages of the selected page and 
	override all earlier properties, select the check box to the left of the 
	input field. </td>
