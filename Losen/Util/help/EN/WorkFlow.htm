    <h1>Workflows </h1>
    <p>EPiServer supports all types of workflow. A workflow is included for 
    multi-step approval as standard. This means that two or more persons must 
    approve or reject the contents of a page before it is published. Workflows 
    is designed to allow the developer to adapt and further develop the flow 
    that exists in order to create new types of flow and adapt them to suit the 
    needs of the customer. </p>
    <p>Here we describe how you create various different workflows of the 
    multi-step approval variety. The purpose with using workflows is to allow 
    the system to issue work tasks to persons who are given this responsibility 
    in advance. You can of course achieve this without setting up the flow in 
    EPiServer, but then you have to issue the task in another way, by e-mail or 
    personally etc. It is good idea to use the same tool for carrying out the 
    task as for issuing it. </p>
    <p>One scenario could be that a person creates a page in EPiServer for news 
    to be published on the public website. Because the news is important and 
    must be correct, two people have to approve the contents of the page before 
    it is published. The first editor creates the page, adds the contents and 
    leaves it for publishing. At this stage a task is sent to the person who is 
    -to examine the page first. This person is given a task on the Activities 
    tab in EPiServer, at the same time as they receive an e-mail telling them 
    they have a task. They logon to the website and determine whether or not to 
    approve the page and can also comment on the page if they want to. When that 
    task is complete,- a new task is sent to the third person in the chain. The 
    task is shown in Activi-ties tab and an e-mail is sent. This person has the 
    task of approving or rejecting the page as well as publishing it if it meets 
    the standards. The whole process of tasks being sent and carried out is 
    managed technically by the system and functions in the way selected when the 
    flow is created.&nbsp; </td>
