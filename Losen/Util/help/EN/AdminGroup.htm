    <h1>Administer Groups</h1>
    <p>
    EPiServer uses the same authorization model as Windows. This means that it 
	is also possible to use existing groups from Windows in EPiServer. From an 
	administrative point of view, this can save you a great deal of work. It is 
	also possible to create your own groups in EPiServer. A third option is to 
	load users via LDAP. There is a protocol that is to be used to communicate 
	with a directory service. In EPiServer, it is used with Active Directory.</p>
	<h2 ALIGN="LEFT">
    Groups created in EPiServer</h2>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
    Use EPiServer’s own management of groups and users if part of your Web site 
	is an extranet. You can also make groups and give them specific read access 
	rights to parts of the Web site. It is also common practice to use 
	EPiServer’s management if the Web site is operated by an operations 
	supplier. In those cases, the server cannot be accessed in the same way, so 
	a simple solution for managing the Web browser is required. </p>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
	Create groups in EPiServer as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select Administer groups on the Admin tab. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select New group.</p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Enter the name and description of the group. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select Add group. </p></li>
	</ol>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
	Note that the groups you create in EPiServer are only available here. It is 
	not possible to create groups in EPiServer in such a way that they are also 
	created in Windows.</p>

	<h2 ALIGN="LEFT">
    Deleting a Group</h2>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
    If you have created groups that you no longer require, you can delete them. 
	There are several ways to delete groups. You can delete a group from 
	Administrate groups by selecting the Delete button displayed to the right 
	after the group. </p>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
    <b>You can also delete a group in the same way as deleting a user.</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select Search for user/group.</p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select the group you want to delete by clicking the 
		group name. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Select Delete at the top of the page.</p></li>
		<li>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Confirm that you want to delete the group in the pop up 
		dialog box.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">
    It is not possible to change the name of an existing group. Delete the 
	existing group and add a new group instead.</p>
    <h2 ALIGN="LEFT">Groups from Windows</h2>
    <p>It is also common practice to use groups and users from Windows if 
	EPiServer is used in the intranet. All employees are usually already part of 
	the network with a unique user name; they also have group authorizations 
	that can be used. Usually all those surfing the intranet are automatically 
	identified using a log in on the computer and the network. </p>
	<p><b>Synchronize groups from Windows in EPiServer as follows:</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select Administer groups on the Admin tab. </li>
		<li>Select Synchronize. A list of all user groups in Windows is 
		displayed. </li>
		<li>Mark the groups to be synchronized </li>
		<li>Select Save </li>
	</ol>
	<p>The groups are now synchronized in EPiServer, which means that you can 
	determine which rights should apply for which groups. Each time a person 
	tries to log on to the Web site the authorization is checked against 
	windows. This means that you do not need to synchronize before you want new 
	groups. All administration of users is carried out in Windows, for example 
	user name, password and group designation. <br>
	When a user with a Windows account has logged on to the Web site for the 
	first time, they are presented as a user in EPiServer’s database. This is to 
	save personalized information about the user. </p>
	<p ALIGN="LEFT">

    <h2>Groups from LDAP</h2>
	<p>In addition to Windows, it is possible to synchronize other directory 
	services such as Novell or AD. An LDAP server, which is a protocol for 
	communicating with a directory service, is used to synchronize groups and 
	users from another directory service. Specify which LDAP server is to be 
	used under the Config tab and System settings. You can read more about how 
	to set up an LDAP server with EPiServer in the document Using LDAP for User 
	Authentication.</p>
	<p><b>Synchronize groups in EPiServer via LDAP as follows:</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select Administer groups on the Admin tab. </li>
		<li>Select Import from LDAP server, or enter a user name / group and 
		click the button. </li>
		<li>Mark the groups to be synchronized.</li>
		<li>Select Save </li>
	</ol>
