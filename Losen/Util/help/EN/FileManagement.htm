	<h1>File Management in EPiServer</h1>
	
	EPiServer has its own file management where you can create folders, copy, move 
	and rename both folders and files. You can upload files and set search 
	criteria for the files. From the inbuilt search function, you can then 
	search for your files. There is also an option to set access rights for 
	differentfolders, so that each editor can see the folders for which he or 
	she is authorised.
	<p>

	<p>All the information which you want to show on your web site must be saved on 
	the web server or a data source to which visitors have access rights. You 
	must therefore upload all pictures and documents which you want to show on 
	your pages to the data sources which are linked to your website. When you 
	upload files you have stored in a different location, the files are copied 
	to the web server. You can upload files by using the file manager or 
	directly from the dialog boxes, Insert image and Insert document.</p>
