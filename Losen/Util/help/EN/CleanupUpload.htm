    <h1>Delete Unused Files</h1>
    <p>When editors upload files on to the Web server, they can opt to load to 
	the Page directory. This then creates a directory that is linked to the page 
	on which the editor is currently working. The directory that has been 
	created is given a name comprised of digits. The file uploaded by the editor 
	is stored in the new directory. When the editor deletes the page from the 
	Web site, the images and documents linked to the page will remain on the Web 
	server. 
	<p>Selecting <i>Delete unused files</i> removes all the directories where 
	the editors have used the Page’s directory. For the files to be deleted from 
	the Web server, the page must be deleted and the Recycle Bin emptied. It 
	takes a further 30 days after the Recycle Bin is emptied, before you can 
	clear files from the upload directory. Note, that this only clears 
	directories that were created by the system and that have names comprised of 
	digits. </td>
