    <h1>Empty Recycle Bin</h1>
    <p>When you have deleted pages from the structure, they are first placed in 
    the recycle bin. The recycle bin should be emptied from time to time. It is 
    possible to arrange automatic emptying of the recycle bin. Check with your 
    system administrator what is applicable for your website. If this is not 
    available, you have to empty the recycle bin yourself. To empty the recycle 
    bin, click on the Empty Recycle Bin tool. Pages that are deleted from the 
    recycle bin cannot be retrieved. A backup copy of the system's database has 
    to be entered instead. Bear in mind that all editors share the same recycle 
    bin, and if you empty it you delete all pages. If you want to delete one 
    single page from the recycle bin, you do it in the same way as when you 
    delete a page from the structure.&nbsp; </p>
    <h1>Remove a page from the recycle bin</h1>
    <p>If you want to remove an individual page from the recycle bin without 
    emptying all the contents it is done in the same way as when you remove a 
    page from the structure. Mark the page in the recycle bin and select the 
    tool Delete in the toolbar.</p>
    <h1>Restore a page from the recycle bin</h1>
    <p>The recycle bin is a separate tree structure under the Structure tab, and 
    you can recognise it by the recycling symbol to the right. If you click on 
    the plus symbol in front of the recycle bin you will see the content. To 
    restore a page, move the page to the par t of the tree where you want the 
    page to be. You can use any of the two different methods of moving a page. </td>
