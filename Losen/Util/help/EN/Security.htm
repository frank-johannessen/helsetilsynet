    <h1>Set Access Rights</h1>
    <p>
    When you have created the group or synchronized the group from another 
	directory service, it is time to specify where in the tree structure the 
	group will have authorization. You must also determine what access rights 
	each group is to have in that part of the structure. <br>
	EPiServer offers six different levels of functions that a group or user can 
	perform on a specific page. Each group or user can have different access 
	rights to each page. There is no hierarchy within these different levels. 
	This means that a group can have access rights that only allow it to read 
	and publish pages and not to create, edit and delete them. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Read</b> means the group/user has the access rights to read the 
		current page.</li>
		<li><b>Create</b> means the group/user has the access rights to create 
		pages under the current page.</li>
		<li><b>Edit</b> means the group/user has the access rights to edit the 
		current page.</li>
		<li><b>Delete</b> means the group/user has the access rights to delete 
		the current page.</li>
		<li><b>Publish</b> means the group/user has the access rights to publish 
		the current page. </li>
		<li><b>Administer</b> means the group/user has the access rights to edit 
		dynamic properties and set access rights for the current page. This 
		level has nothing to do with admin mode, except to administer one or 
		several pages in edit mode.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Specify access rights for one or several pages as follows:</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select Set access rights on the Admin tab. The tree structure is 
		displayed in the lower section of the window.</li>
		<li>Mark the page in the tree structure for which you want to set access 
		rights. When the page is highlighted, the name of the page is displayed 
		in bold type. </li>
		<li>Those groups and individuals that have access rights to the 
		highlighted page are shown with the most recently saved access rights 
		above the structure. If you also want other groups or individuals to 
		have these access rights, select Add group or Add user and then select 
		the ones you want. When you add a group or user, no settings will be 
		saved; you will only see the information in the window. </li>
		<li>Specify the level of access rights each group or individual is to 
		have. </li>
		<li>Save the new access rights by selecting the correct button above the 
		groups. The four similar buttons have different functions and are needed 
		at different times.</li>
	</ol>

        the rights displayed on the screen for the highlighted page and its 
        subpages. You can therefore save the access rights for several pages at 
        the same time. Any rights saved previously are overwritten.</td>

        adding the rights displayed on the screen for the highlighted page and 
        its subpages, without changing the rights applicable to other groups/users. 
        If you remove from the window the groups not to be modified they will 
        not be affected. When you click on Clear it only means that you are 
        clearing the group from the display. In other words, you are not 
        clearing the group from the system. Recursive add is a much more 
        appropriate option to use if you have many different rights in a 
        structure and want to add or change one or more groups.</td>
