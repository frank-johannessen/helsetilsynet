    <h1>Settings for extranet users</h1>
    <p>You have the option of allowing your visitors to register on your website 
    to be able to login and obtain extended functionality offered by your 
    website. You can decide whether you want to confirm registration before it 
    is activated or whether the whole process should take place automatically. 
    To activate the service, check the Allow self registration option and 
    complete the rest of the settings according to the required function.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>In the <i>Standard group for new users</i> field, select which group 
      the users are to belong to. You create or synchronise in groups under 
      Administer group info. Set rights in the tree structure for the pages 
      which the registered users will have access to.</li>
      <li><font FACE="GillSans Light" SIZE="2"></font>In the Minimum length 
      required for password, specify the minimum number of characters visitors 
      must use in order for their password to be approved. </li>
      <li>Select Require letters in the password to demand that the visitor 
      specifies a password that contains letters.</li>
      <li>Select Require digits in the password to demand that the visitor 
      specifies a password that contains numbers.</li>
      <li>Select Require symbols in the password to demand that the visitor 
      specifies a password that contains symbols.</li>
      <li>In the Maximum number of failed logon attempts before account is 
      locked, you specify how many times a visitor can try to logon before the 
      account is blocked. </li>
      <li>Check the <i>Auto activate user at registration</i> option if you want 
      registration to take place automatically. This means that users can log in 
      immediately after registration and none of the administration involved 
      with new registrations is required.</li>
      <li>If you want to check who is registering on the website, do not select 
      the option for activating registration automatically. You should instead 
      enter the e-mail address of the person who will be processing the 
      registration in the field <i>E-mail address for new registrations</i>.</li>
      <li>In the <i>Sender address on outgoing mail</i> field enter an e-mail address 
      for the e-mail message to be sent from the website to the users.</li>
      <li>Enter the subject and heading for the message to be sent to the user 
      when registration is complete.</li>
      <li>Enter the subject and heading for the message to be sent to the user 
      when registration is confirmed.  </li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you have saved your settings 
      registration is activated automatically on the website. A visitor can then 
      reg-ister on a page you created using the template Register user. When 
      registration is complete an e-mail message is sent to the e-mail address 
      specified for processing. It contains a link to the user’s account in 
      EPiServer. Click on the link and activate the user by marking the Active 
      check box on the page. You can now decide whether to send an e-mail to the 
      user or not. If you decide to, the content entered in the two bottom 
      fields under <i>Settings for extranet</i> users will be sent.</td>
