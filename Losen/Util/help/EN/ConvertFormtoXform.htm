					<h1>Convert Form</h1>
					<P>A new form engine has been developed for EPiServer 4.50. The main reason for the 
						restructure is to allow greater technical possibilities. Forms that are created 
						with the new form editor are created in a format called XForms. XForms enhances 
						the possiblities to customize forms compared to the old technology.
					</P>
					<P>If you have upgraded an existing EPiServer to version 4.50 or later, it is 
						likely that you have some old forms on the Web site. The Convert Form function 
						allows you to convert the old forms to the new technology XForms. There are 
						several reasons to convert the existing forms, e.g. so that it is possible to 
						maintain the forms with the new form editor. It is also possible to use the 
						same form on many different pages - a function that has been requested by many 
						EPiServer users.</P>
					<P><b> How to convert a form:</b></P>
					<ol>
						<li>
						Select Convert Form from the Config tab.
						<li>
						A list of all the forms that use the old forms technology is displayed in the 
						Select a Form to Convert box.
						<LI>
						Select the form(s) that you want to convert.
						<li>
							Click Convert.</li>
