    <h1>Product updates</h1>
    <p>New versions of EPiServer are released every now and then. Some new 
    releases contain a great deal of new functionality, while others contain 
    minor changes and perhaps mostly bug fixes. If your website is connected to 
    the Internet you can upgrade to new versions via the administration 
    interface without any need to shut down the website. For this function to 
    work, your original version of EPiServer must be version 4 or later.</p>
    <p>If your website does not have an Internet connection or allow files to be 
    downloaded from the Internet you need to upgrade your version by running the 
    installation program which comes on the CD from your supplier.</p>
    <p>You can always see which version of EPiServer you are using from the web 
    browser’s name list when you are logged in as editor or administrator.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select Product updates and confirm that you want to download files 
      from the Internet.</li>
      <li>In the window which appears there is a list with the version you have 
      installed, which also indicates whether there are new releases to be 
      downloaded.</li>
      <li>Select Upgrade if you want to download the new files.</li>
      <li>When the files have been downloaded onto your machine, select Install 
      to install the new release.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;A message appears indicating when installation is complete. 
      Close the web browser and open it again, then log in. You can now access 
      the new version of EPiServer.</li>
    </ol>
