	<h1>File version management</h1>
	In the file manager you can track different versions of the file using the 
	version manager. You can see the history of the file, when it was created, 
	by whom and any comments. As editor you can check documents in and out that 
	you are working on so that nobody can modify the file at the same time as 
	you. Access version management through the file manager menu that opens when 
	you right-click a file. <br>
	If you cannot see the functions, this may be because version management is 
	set to be active only in certain places in the folder structure. Check this 
	with your system administrator. 
	<br>
	<h2>Checking files in and out</h2>
	When you check out a file it is locked so that nobody can modify it at the 
	same time as you. However, despite it being locked, other editors or 
	visitors to your Web site can see the content.<br>
	When you have made your changes and want to make the file accessible to 
	others, check it in in the file manager. You can also add a comment in which 
	you briefly describe the changes that you have made. Comments make it easier 
	for other editors to understand the content of the latest version and the 
	changes that have been made. <br>
	<h2>
	Integrated with Microsoft Office</h2>
	Version management is associated with the Office programs, Word, Excel and 
	PowerPoint, and allows you to open files in these programs directly from the 
	file manager. When you have made your changes you can check in the files and 
	make comments on your changes directly from the Office programs. <br>
	<h2>
	Working with version management through Office programs</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click the file you want to edit. </li>
		<li>Select Check out. Your user name is 
	displayed in the Checked out by column indicating that the file is locked by

		<li>Right-click on the file again. Select Edit in Office. If you have selected a 
	Word file to edit, Microsoft Word opens automatically.</li>

		<li>Enter your comment and select OK. A new version has been created and is 
	available for editors and visitors to the Web site.<br></li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Undoing Check out</h2>
	If you do not make any changes to the document that you have checked out, 
	restore it by right-clicking on the file you checked out and select Undo 
	Check out.<br>

	and also see a comment about the changes. Right-click the file you want to 
	see the history of. Select Version history. <br>
