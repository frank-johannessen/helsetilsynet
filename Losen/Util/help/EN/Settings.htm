    <p>In system settings, you make settings which apply to the 
    whole of EPiServer. You can change language, paths to various parts of the 
    web server, etc. These settings are usually set during installation and are 
    rarely changed.</p>

      <h3>Name of the web site</h3>
      The name that will be displayed in the title bar at 
      the top of the web browser's window.
	<h3>Address to your web site</h3>
      The URL of a website is used in several contexts in 
      EPiServer, for example in subscriptions. In this instance you enter the 
      URL of your website so that the correct information is sent to the users.
     
      <h3>Default language</h3>
      Edit and Admin mode can be displayed in different 
      languages. This allows you to select the language which is appropriate for 
      your EPiServer. Remember that the information stored in the database does 
      not change when you change language in this case. You can read more about 
      changing languages in the section Language selection in EPiServer . If the 
      editor has actually selected a language under My settings, this language 
      will apply to the editor, regardless of what the default language is.
      
    <h3>Encrypting the web.config file </h3>
    The web.config file contains information about the system that could be 
    sensitive in the wrong hands. This includes information to and from the 
    database. To ensure that nobody can see what the information contains, you 
    encrypt the file. Select the alternative you want and save system sett-ings. 
    The information on the database connection is then encrypted. 
	<h3>Error handling in EPiServer</h3>
	If a technical error occurs in EPiServer, an error message will appear 
	that is not much help to an editor. However, this is useful to a developer 
	in solving the problem. By activating this function, the editor receives a 
	form that is to be filled in whenever a technical problem arises. This 
	information is then sent to the e-mail address specified in the E-mail 
	address to send the error report field. 
	<h3>E-mail address to send error reports to</h3>
	The e-mail address that is to receive the error report from website 
	users.
      <h3>Handler for subscription updates</h3>
	EPiServer has a subscription functionality that makes it possible for visitors to the Web site&nbsp;to 
	subscribe to information about new and updated pages. It is possible to 
	change how subscriptions are managed depending on whether your Web site uses 
	EPiServer's multi-language functionality. This list can also contain 
	customised solutions from the subscription function.

      <h3>Selecting an editor</h3>
	Version 4.20 of EPiServer launched a new editor. This is a 
	dhtml-based editor with increased functionality compared with the previous 
	version. The previous editor, which was an Active-X component, can still be 
	used. The version that is to be used, is specified in the web.config file 
	that is stored in the root of the website. The string &lt;add 
	key=&quot;EPfHtmlEditor&quot; value=&quot;True&quot;/&gt; states that the DHTML-editor is being 
	used. The string &lt;add key=&quot;EPfHtmlEditor&quot; value=&quot;False&quot;/&gt; states that the 
	Active-X component is being used.
	<h3>Use DIV in editor instead of P</h3>
      In HTML there are different ways of indicating that 
      you want a paragraph break. When you use the symbol &lt;P&gt; there will always 
      be a gap between the rows to indicate the beginning of a new paragraph. If 
      you do not want the extra distance to be visible when pressing ENTER you 
      can instead use the symbol &lt;DIV&gt;. If you place a tick in the box, &lt;DIV&gt; is 
      used instead of &lt;P&gt;. Note that the change will only apply to pages created 
      after the change has been made.
      <h3>Height of the Editor </h3>
      The height of the Editor expressed in pixels. This 
      value applies for all edit fields, regardless of page type.
      <h3>Width of the Editor </h3>
      The width of the Editor expressed in pixels. If the 
      value is zero, the width of the Editor is changed in proportion to the 
      window. 
      <h3>Max number of old versions of a page</h3>
      Specifies how many old versions of each page that can 
      be stored by the editor. The value zero (0) allows editors to store an 
      unlimited number of old versions. If you enter a value here, for example 
      3, three old versions are stored plus the published version, i.e. four 
      versions in all. When a fifth version is created the first version of the 
      stored page will disappear. 
      <h3>Path to CSS file for the Editor</h3>
      The path to the CSS file that controls the profile of 
      the editor. This should be the same as the one that controls the profile 
      of the website, to make it easy for the editors. 
      <h3>Current version of ActiveX editor</h3>
      In this field, you can specify the version of the Active-X Editor that you 
	want your editors to use. If you specify a version that is older than the 
	one already installed on the editor’s computer, the latest version will be 
	downloaded the next time the editor edits a page.

      editor opens the link tool to upload files to the web server.

      <h2><a name="LDAP"></a>LDAP</h2>
    LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and is a 
      protocol which is used for communicating with a directory service. This is 
      used in EPiServer, along with Active Directory, for monitoring users and 
      groups in the various types of network.</p>

      <h3>LDAP server</h3>
      Enter in this field the LDAP server address
      <h3>Username for reading info from LDAP server</h3>
      In this field you enter the username for a Windows account which has 
      rights to read data from the LDAP server. 
      <h3>Password for username</h3>
      Enter in this field the password for the user specified above.
&nbsp;<h3>Clear LDAP cache</h3>
	By selecting Clear, you will empty the cache storing information from the 
	LDAP server. The cache is there to speed up the system, however it may need 
	to be emptied occasionally, if extensive changes have been made.&nbsp;</td>
