    <h1>Edit Property</h1>
    <p>Each page type has a number of different properties. These are the 
    properties which generate the functions of the specific page type. If you 
    are an administrator it may be advisable for you to know how these functions 
    are created and operate. The reason for this is that it will enable you to 
    change certain settings, making it easier for your editors to use the page 
    types. The page type Ordinary web page is shown below, along with its 
    various properties. It has eight identical properties, which are displayed 
    on the right when you click on the page type’s name in the menu on the left.</p>
    <p>

    <p>Most of the properties operate in the same way, which means that if you 
    have learnt how one works, you will easily understand how the others work. 
    We will now have a closer look at the MainBody property, which is one of the 
    most common properties available in most page types. MainBody is the editing 
    feature which the editor uses to create content, insert images in the page, 
    etc.</p>
    <h2>Name</h2>
    The property’s name is entered here. This name should not be changed 
    because the ASPX page which creates the page for the visitor refers to the 
    various properties’ names. If you change the name, you cannot be sure that 
    the page will be displayed.
    <h2>Edit Heading</h2>
    You enter under Edit heading the text to be displayed next to the field 
    when the page type is used.You can change this to suit your editors so that 
    they easily know what should be entered in the field.
    <h2>Help Text</h2>
    Help text is the text which is displayed if the editor points with the 
    mouse at the Edit heading. You can use this to provide some extra help as to 
    what should be entered in the specific field.
    <h2>Type</h2>
    The Type option specifies the type of field to be used for this property. 
    All page types are structured like forms and are based on different 
    properties, which are different types of form fields. For this option you 
    can choose to have an integer, string, page, date, etc. When you choose Long 
    string you always have the option to use the HTML editor.
    <h2>Place under heading</h2>
    Most page templates have a number of headings (tabs), which the editor 
    can toggle between to enter information. This option allows you to choose 
    under which tab you want this property to be displayed for the editor. In 
    certain cases, it may be advisable to create a tab, which only 
    administrators have access to and place certain properties under this tab. 
    The main thing is to facilitate the editor’s task.
    <h2>No default value</h2>
    The option No default value indicates that you do not want there to be 
    any information available in the field when the editor uses the page type. 
    You must specify one of the three options: No default value, Inherits value 
    or Default value.
    <h2>Inherits value</h2>
    The option Inherits valueindicates that the value from the page located 
    above this page in the structure is displayed in the field. The editor does 
    have the option, however, to change this value.
    <h2>Default value</h2>
    In the Default value field you have the option to enter a default text 
    for this property whenever the editor uses the page type.
    <h2>Value must be entered</h2>
    In the Value must be entered field you can make sure that the editor 
    always enters a value in this field. If the editor leaves it blank and saves 
    the page, an error message will appear indicating that information is 
    missing.
    <h2>Searchable property</h2>
    The Searchable property option allows you to decide whether the 
    information entered for this property will be searchable or not. All 
    properties are searchable by default, but it may occasionally be advisable 
    to remove this feature.
    <h2>Properties for the Editor</h2>
    In the Properties for the Editor field you can specify which buttons will 
    be available for the editor in the editing application. By selecting 
    different options you can control what the editors can do using this editing 
    tool. If you uncheck all the options this property will become a normal 
    input field like a text box.</td>
