    <h1>Creating workflows </h1>
    <p>To create a new workflow select, Workflow from the menu to the left of 
    Admin mode. Existing workflows on the website are listed on the right hand 
    side of the page. You create a new flow by selecting Create new workflow. 
    The form for the settings of the workflow is now shown on four tabs. Make 
    your settings on the various tabs and select Save at the top above the tabs.
    </p>
    <h2>General </h2>
    On the General tab, you specify general information about the flow.
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="images/workflow_general.png" width="490" height="310"></p>
    <h3>Name </h3>
    Specify the name of the flow. If the flow is to be started manually, the 
    name should be as descriptive as possible so that the editor can see the 
    difference between different flows.
    <h3>Owner of the flow </h3>
    Who is to be the owner of the flow. You can choose a certain person or 
    group to be owner of the flow-. This person will receive an e-mail when 
    tasks are carried out and when a task is beginning to lapse. You can also 
    decide that the person who is logged in and activates the flow should also 
    be owner of the flow by selecting Logged on user as owner.
    <h3>Allowing manual start </h3>
    There is an option for setting automatic activation of the flow at a 
    certain place in the tree structure. In some cases it could be appropriate 
    to let the editors activate the flow themselves to ensure that a page 
    situated in another part of the tree structure can go through the flow. If 
    you want to allow manual start, select that option. 
    <h3>Actions for when there is a conflict between flow and publishing the 
    page </h3>
    When a page is included in a workflow with multi-step approval, the 
    persons in the workflow do not normally have the right to publish the page. 
    In some cases you can give them, or somebody else, the right to publish even 
    if you would rather have the page approved by one or more persons before 
    publishing. This could mean that a person enters the system and publishes a 
    page in the flow that is waiting to be approved by somebody else. You have 
    the option to choose what to do at such a conflict. 
    <p><b>No action </b>means that the page is published and that the flow 
    continues to allocate tasks. </p>
    <p><b>Do not allow publication </b>means that the page is not published and 
    that the flow continues to allocate tasks.</p>
    <p><b>Cancel the flow </b>means that the page is published and the flow is 
    cancelled and no more tasks are allocated. </p>
    <h3>Description </h3>
    A brief description of the flow, this text is visible for the editor
    <h2>Flow description </h2>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/workflow_flow.png" width="490" height="310"></p>
    <h3>Name </h3>
    To add a new person or group to the flow, select the person or group from 
    the drop-down menu and select Add new step. The name of the person or group 
    is presented in a list and you can specify the tasks of this person or 
    group.
    <h3>Type </h3>
    In the Type field you select what the task means. If the person is to 
    Check or Publish a page. 
    <h3>Time-limited task </h3>
    If you want the task to be carried out within a certain time span you can 
    specify this in the Time-limited task-field. You can choose to specify a 
    whole number followed by a unit of a minute, hour or day. If a task is 
    lapsing, an e-mail will be sent to the person allocated the task and to the 
    owner of the flow.
    <h3>Actions for refused task </h3>
    If a person or group refuses the task, you can decide if the task should 
    continue in the flow or if the flow should be cancelled.
    <h3>Placement within the flow </h3>
    The buttons to the far right of each person or group 
    allows you to move persons or groups within the flow. The up arrow moves 
    persons or groups one step up, the down arrow one step down. A tick removes 
    a person or group from the flow. 
    <h2>Automatic activation </h2>
    The Automatic activation tab allows you to specify what 
    should be allowed to start automatic activation and where in the tree 
    structure this should take place. 
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    <img border="0" src="images/workflow_autoact.png" width="490" height="310"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When an editor saves and previews a page there are two 
    alternatives for publishing. The alternatives activated depends on which 
    rights the editor has. If the editor has the right to publish information, 
    the Publish and Ready for publishing buttons are both activated. If the 
    editor does not have the right to publish, then only the Ready for 
    publishing button is activated. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can choose which or if both of these buttons should 
    apply to automatic activation of the workflow. </p>
    <h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Places on the tree structure where automatic activation 
    applies </h3>
    You can point out one or more places on the tree 
    structure where automatic activation should apply. If it concerns the entire 
    website, you point out the start page. If you select the page at the top of 
    the struc-ture where you want it to apply, all the subpages will also be 
    selected. Select Add new activation point. The Link to a page dialogue box 
    opens and you can point out the page on the tree structure where you want 
    the flow to be automatically activated.
    <h2>Activated flows </h2>
    <p>
    <img border="0" src="images/workflow_active.png" width="490" height="310"></p>
    <p>If you as administrator want to see the flows that are currently using 
    the workflow, there is a list of all activated flows under the Activated 
    flows tab. You can see who has been allocated a task but has not yet 
    implemented it. You can also see implemented tasks and comments left by the 
    editor. You can also remove the flow from here. You remove the active flow, 
    not the entire workflow. </p>
    <h2>Editing the workflow </h2>
    If a person leaves and somebody else comes to replace them, you can edit 
    the existing flows. Select Workflow from the menu to the left of Admin mode. 
    Existing workflows on the website are listed on the right hand side of the 
    page. Click on the name of the flow in the list to edit the workflow. Make 
    your settings on the various tabs and select Save at the top above the tabs.
   
    <h2>Removing workflows </h2>
    If you want to remove an entire workflow you can do this from Admin mode. 
    Select Workflow from the menu to the left of Admin mode. Existing workflows 
    on the website are listed on the right hand side of the page. Click on the 
    name of the flow in the list to remove the workflow. Then select Remove top 
    right above the tabs. Remember that all activated flows within this workflow 
    are concluded if you remove it.
