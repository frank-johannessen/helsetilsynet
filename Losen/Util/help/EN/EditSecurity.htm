    <h1>Access Rights for Page</h1>
    <p>In EPiServer it is possible to give different visitors different 
    authorisations on the website. This means that you can display certain pages 
    to a particular visitor but hide the same pages from others. If a visitor is 
    not entitled to read a page, this visitor will not see the page in the menu. 
    This means that the visitor does not actually know that there is information 
    on the web site he is not allowed to see. </p>
    <p>To set privileges for a page, begin by selecting the page and then 
    choosing the Access rights button in the toolbar. The page will then be 
    opened in which you can choose to set privileges for a group or for par 
    ticular individuals. When you open the page, you can see which groups and 
    individuals currently have various privileges for the page in question. By 
    choosing Add group or Add user you can display more groups and individuals 
    in the list.</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="images/rattighet_sida.png" width="490" height="268"></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">By clicking in the check boxes, you can delete or set 
    privileges for various groups and individuals. If the check box contains a 
    tick, this means that the group or person is entitled to do what is 
    displayed. If the box is empty, these privileges are absent. For example, if 
    you do not want the group Everyone to be able to read the Rule of 
    usability-page, they should not have a tick in the box under Read. When you 
    have chosen the privileges that are to apply for the page in question, 
    choose the Save button at the top of the window.</td>
